<p>Yesterday, the SEC <a href="http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370540017677#.UmkrCZTN73E">voted unanimously</a> to propose rules for equity crowdfunding. In the statements leading up to the vote, Commissioner Stein cited the importance of cost-effective recordkeeping solutions for issuers offering and selling securities through crowdfunding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><span>“A business simply must be able to track who its owners are. While I understand that requiring a registered transfer agent would increase the costs to an issuer, I would like to hear from commenters about possible third-party, cost-effective solutions to help crowdfunding issuers manage their recordkeeping responsibilities.” </span></em><span><span>&#8212; SEC Commissioner Kara M. Stein, October 23, 2013</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We clearly agree. Not only as a method for fraud prevention, but as ardent supporters of greater information transparency for all parties. That&#8217;s why Sharewave exists, to help private companies easily and cost-effectively maintain their shareholder records, transfer journals, employee options and company documents.</p>
