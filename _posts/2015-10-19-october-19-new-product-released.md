Here are some highlights of new product now on Sharewave:

<h2 style="text-align: left">83(b)</h2>
If you've got restricted stock grants that could benefit from an 83(b) filing with the IRS we'll now generate the documentation for you. Just head to the grant and you'll be prompted to generate the form. It'll also come with notes on what to do it with it and where to send it.

<h2 style="text-align: left">100K Rule</h2>
Adding to our system reporting, we'll now let you know whenever you're issuing if you're breaching the ISO 100K rule.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Dividends</h2>
We've allowed you to enter dividends for some time but we'll now track their accrual for you and include them in the waterfall modeling. Any investors with access to their transactions will also be able to track accrual.
