*Every week we hand select thoughts and ideas from the startup community that we find most interesting.*

**Charlie O'Donnell of Brooklyn Bridge Ventures** lays out [Five Tips for Getting PR for Your Startup](http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2014/9/8/five-tips-for-getting-pr-for-your-startup.html). They are: 1) Reach industry reporters when you don't need something, 2) follow their social accounts, 3) split up the story, 4) collaborate with other startups, and 5) create an editorial schedule.

**Boris Wertz of Version One Ventures** details four key drawbacks to taking more money than needed in early stages in [What’s the problem with too much funding?](http://versiononeventures.com/whats-problem-much-funding/) They are: 1) Solving problems with non-scalable hacks, 2) losing creativity, 3) tackling too many things at the same time, and 4) the culture of *we've done it*.

**Mark Suster of Upfront Ventures** understands that cancelling meetings is part of modern day life, but reminds us of etiquette in [Here’s How to Cancel a Meeting the Right Way](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2014/09/13/heres-how-to-cancel-a-meeting-the-right-way/).

**Tom Tunguz of Redpoint** lists his favorite ideas from Peter Thiel's upcoming book *Zero to One* in [A Collection of Uncommon Points of View on Startups](http://tomtunguz.com/zero-to-one/). They are: 1) Founders should aim to create monopolies, 2) Disruption is the wrong mindset, and 3) The four lessons we learned from the dot-com era are wrong.
