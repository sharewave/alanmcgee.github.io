Here are some highlights of new product now on Sharewave:

<h2 style="text-align: left">Certificates</h2>
We've given our certificates an overhaul. They're now much easier to generate and share as well as being easier on the eye,

<br><br>
You'll see the new certificate workflow when you jump back into Sharewave. They're part of the issuing workflows so for existing customers you'll need to edit your security to add the required fields (facsimile signatures), more here to get you started.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Intelligence Engine</h2>
As you build out your cap table it's easy to make mistakes, Sharewave will now do everything to help you avoid them. For example: we'll alert you if you're overissuing a security, exercising more than you've vested, issuing stock below your current fair market value and in many more situations across the platform.

<h2 style="text-align: left">A better document viewer</h2>
We've partnered with the great folks at Box to give you a better way to view your documents. You'll notice you can now scroll through pages as well as zoom in and out. Documents now also load on top of what you're currently working on making the site faster and more responsive to your current task.
