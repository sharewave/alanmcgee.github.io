Here are some highlights of new product now on Sharewave:

<h2 style="text-align: left">Certificates</h2>
We've given our certificates an overhaul. They're now super straightforward to generate and share as well as being considerably easier on the eye!

<br><br>
You'll see the new certificate workflow when you jump back into Sharewave. They're part of the issuing workflows so for existing customers you'll need to edit your securities to add the required fields (facsimile signatures).

<h2 style="text-align: left">Intelligence Engine</h2>
As you build out your cap table it's easy to make mistakes &ndash; Sharewave will now do everything to help you avoid them. For example: we'll alert you if you're overissuing a security, exercising more than you've vested, issuing stock below your current fair market value and in many more situations across the platform.

<h2 style="text-align: left">A better document viewer</h2>
We've partnered with the [great folks at Box](https://www.box.com) to give you a better way to view your documents. You'll notice you can now scroll through pages as well as zoom in and out. Documents now also load on top of what you're currently working on making the site faster and more responsive to your current task.

* Issue multiple forms of equity compensation out of the same pool
* A redesign of the navigation to give you more useable screen real estate
* Better tracking of your investors, see who you've shared to and what you've shared, whether they've signed up and the option to send reminders to those who haven't.
