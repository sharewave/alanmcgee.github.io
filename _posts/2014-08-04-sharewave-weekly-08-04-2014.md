*Every week we hand select thoughts and ideas from the startup community that we find most interesting.*

**Rob Go of Nextview** lists three reasons why seed companies should have board meetings in [Are Board Meetings and Board Decks a Waste of Time At The Seed Stage?](http://robgo.org/2014/07/29/board-meetingsdecks-complete-waste-time/) The list: 1) It forces a cadence of accountability, 2) it provides strategic time with outsiders, 3) governance and 4) preperation for the future.

**Hunter Walk of Homebrew** discourages small companies from delegating fundraising in [Don’t Send a Banker to Do a Founder’s Job: Seed Fundraising Can’t Be Outsourced](http://hunterwalk.com/2014/08/01/dont-send-a-banker-to-do-a-founders-job-seed-fundraising-cant-be-outsourced/).

**Tom Tunguz of Redpoint** explains how exceptional storytelling makes you want to believe, suspend doubt, and disregard the great risks that startups face in [The Secret Ingredient to the Best Startup Fundraising Pitches](http://tomtunguz.com/inevitability/).

**Charlie O'Donnell of BBV** publishes a note written to a young company that recently raised money and moved into a new office in [Step Up](http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2014/7/28/step-up.html).
