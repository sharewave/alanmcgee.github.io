We've explored the math behind convertible notes and the role they play in future rounds in earlier posts. However one area we did not explore was the difference between pre and post-money conversions. Amazingly this detail is not always included in the terms of a note agreement yet it can make a massive difference to the outcome of a new round of financing.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Who gets diluted?</h2>

At its core this problem boils down to who gets diluted.
In a pre-money conversion the notes convert first, all existing holders are diluted. Then the incoming series gets their full expected percentage of the company diluting everyone else including the newly converted convertible note holders.
In a post-money scenario, the incoming series go first so the note holders get their full percentage diluting out the new series.

<h2 style="text-align: left">A concrete example</h2>

I hope that makes sense in the abstract, but let's work through an example to go through the details. We'll use the same basic cap table we used in our earlier post on round modeling so if you've got any questions about the round model more generally do check that out first.

<div class="example-block">
    <p>The company has just three securities:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span>Common</span> An Equity Series with 90,000 shares issued</li>
        <li><span>Options</span> An options series with 10,000 authorized but only 5,000 issued</li>
        <li><span>Debt A</span> A Debt series with $100,000 invested at a 20% discount.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This company is doing a Series A of $1,000,000 at a pre-money valuation of $4,000,000. The incoming investors are requesting a 10% post-money option pool.</p>
