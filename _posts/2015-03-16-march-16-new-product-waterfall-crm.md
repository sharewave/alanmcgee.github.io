Lately we've been building product so quickly that we've not stopped to announce what's new. Here are some of the highlights that you'll now notice on Sharewave:

<h2 style="text-align: left">Waterfall modeling</h2>
One of the many tools we're building on top of cap table data. Model varying exit prices for your company, and see how the proceeds are released by share class and by shareholder.

We'll soon be writing about the math that goes on behind the scenes. It's critical to understand how the structure of your equity and debt come into play during liquidity events.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Contact profiles</h2>
Organize and view each contact's information, permissions, associated documents and transactions in one place.

<br><br>

<h2 style="text-align: left">Security views</h2>
A simpler way to view your shareholders, investors or option holders within a specific security. The columns in each tab vary by security type, so you can review meaningful highlights along with the pro rata ownership for the class and for the company.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Big updates to the cap table</h2>
You used to have to toggle between editing and viewing the cap table, now everything is one view and easily editable by diving into transaction using the right side rail. And you no longer need to visit the cap table to make edits, now you can edit a transaction from anywhere it's listed on the platform.

There are also two big buttons at the top to create a new security, or to issue new transactions. You'll also notice these buttons throughout the site, which means you can quickly create new classes of shares or issue new shares, options, warrants or convertibles much more quickly.

The cap table is also now searchable, and by default we'll show the first 50 rows to make larger cap tables more manageable. We also have additional customizations coming that will give you more control this summary view.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Valuation history</h2>
Keep a history of 409a valuations, including the underlying valuation report tied to each entry. We'll be using this valuation data in a number of places throughout the platform to enhance editing, reviewing and modeling your data.
