*Every week we hand select thoughts and ideas from the startup community that we find most interesting.*

**Accenture** poured through CB Insights data reviewing of New York City in [The Rise of Fintech](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-reports/NY-FinTech-Report.pdf). A few highlights: 1) New York is the fastest growing fintech cluster in the US, 2) deal volume is growing 31% annually, more than the global and US averages, and 3) NY tech employment is up 21% compared to a 12% US average.

**CB Insights** looks at three months of startup failures in [The R.I.P. Report – Startup Death Trends](https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/startup-death-data). The highlights: 1) companies typically die around ~20 months after their last financing round and after having raised $1.3 million, and 2) companies in the social industry saw the highest of number of startup failures.

**Mark Suster of Upfront Ventures** explains his optimism about venture capital in [Why Venture Capital is So Much More Compelling Now](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2014/06/29/why-venture-capital-is-so-much-more-compelling-now/).

**Shri Bhashyam of EquityZen** questions what the SEC may decide this summer as they review the definition of an "Accredited Investor" in [Will Angels Lose Their Wings?](http://equityzen.com/blog/accredited-investor-standards-SEC-review).

**José Ancer from Silicon Hills Lawyer** discusses the obligations in legal agreements from accelerators, from basic terms to those that are abused at the founders expense in [Startup Accelerators: The Legal Terms](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2014/07/01/startup-accelerators-legal-terms/).

**Tom Tunguz of Redpoint** analyzes the latest Crunchbase data to calculate the hometown share from the 10 major startups cities in [The importance of hometown investors for startups](http://tomtunguz.com/hometown-investment/). The data varies by financing round, but looking across all dollars raised San Francisco unsurprisingly comes in first at 53% hometown (e.g. 53 cents of every dollar raised by SF startups is invested by SF investors).
