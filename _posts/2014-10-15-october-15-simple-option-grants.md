There are a few routine parts of your business that have a habit of quickly getting out of hand. They often result in a weekend spent slaying an administrative beast, leaving you promising yourself that it won't happen again. Managing option grants is one of those things.

Stock options need to be issued with the correct paperwork, recorded in the cap table, and meticulously managed to keep track of vesting milestones, forfeitures and exercises over time. That's important stuff that impacts hiring, fundraising, and other decisions that require an understanding of your current and future ownership structure. It's also time consuming stuff, and usually falls on the shoulders of founders or C-level execs with little time to give.

We put a lot of thought into improving stock option grant management, so we're excited to share our work.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Simple setup</h2>
Enter our three-step stock option flow, and you'll see the screen below. You can pick an existing option pool from your Sharewave cap table, or create one from scratch.

Add your option plan, option agreement template, and a notice of exercise that will all be shared with employees every time a grant is issued. Using Sharewaveâ€™s document tools, you can quickly open and prepare your templates to be filled with grant information. That's it, now to lay out who's getting how many.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Send one, or one hundred option grants</h2>
Every field you added in your templates is now listed. Select an existing shareholder or type an email address for a new recipient, and complete their unique grant details. If you're granting options to many people at once, just copy and paste directly from a spreadsheet.<br><br>

<h2 style="text-align: left">Review and send</h2>
Hitting send after adding your recipients would have made sense, but we added one more screen for peace of mind. After all, you're giving away pieces of your company. Confirm the grant details, and open the documents for each person if you want to review exactly what they'll see with their numbers now entered into the documents.<br><br>

<h2 style="text-align: left">All digital, no data entry</h2>
At Sharewave, we don't send any paperwork over email. Each recipient will get an email notifying them of their grant, with a unique link to review their paperwork. This keeps their documents available in the cloud within a secure and personal account, at no extra cost to your company. It also enables you to confirm they've received and opened the email, and viewed the documents. 

If you've requested signatures, they can sign and return through the platform for your approval. Each grant transaction can then be viewed in detail, to see a complete history from the initial grant through every exercise and forfeit events.

At the end of this process, each grant is automatically entered into your cap table and the vesting schedule (if there was one) is effective on the listed grant date. Not only will employees keep access to their documents, but they'll be able to follow their vesting milestones over time.

We've got a few great additions in store for this, and hope you find it useful! It's available today on all plans.
