*Every week we hand select thoughts and ideas from the startup community that we find most interesting.*

Investors and founders continued to focus on burn rates this week, after [Fred Wilson wrote on the topic](http://avc.com/2014/09/burn-baby-burn/) last week in response to [Bill Gurley's interview with the Wall Street Journal](http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gurley-silicon-valley-is-taking-on-too-much-risk-2014-9).

**Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz** quickly launched into a [burn rate tweetstorm](http://tweetstorm.io/user/pmarca/515221824423346176) agreeing with Bill and Fred's points of view, and detailing the consequences of burning cash too quickly.

**Danielle Morrill of Mattermark** reacted to the alarm bells by self-examining her own startup, and posted her process for the benefit of Seed & Series A startups in [Is My Startup Burn Rate Normal?](https://medium.com/@DanielleMorrill/is-my-startup-burn-rate-normal-882b2bd20f02)

**Mark Suster of Upfront Ventures** then responded to Danielle's post by setting up a framework for founders to better understand [What is the Right Burn Rate at a Startup Company?](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2014/09/28/what-is-the-right-burn-rate-at-a-startup-company/) His focus is on gross burn vs net burn, growth vs profitability, availability of capital, and valuation.

Though not everyone was talking about burn rates; here are a few more posts that made us think this week:

**Shri Bhashyam of EquityZen** recently raised a seed round, and started digging into traction metrics that investors will look for next time in [The Metrics Required for Raising a Series A Round](https://equityzen.com/blog/metrics-required-for-series-a/).

**Sam Altman of YCombinator** kicked off CS183B at Stanford this week (preceded by Peter Thiel's class in 2012), which is on Genius in both video and annotated form in [Lecture 1: How to Start a Startup](http://tech.genius.com/Sam-altman-lecture-1-how-to-start-a-startup-annotated).

**The New  York Times** compares the wisdom of the crowd against VCs in [Crowdfunding and Venture Funding: More Alike Than You Think](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/crowdfunding-and-venture-funding-more-alike-than-you-think).
