<h2 style="text-align: left">409a</h2>
We recently announced our 409a partnership which allow us to offer 409a valuations that are fast, simply priced and audit defensible. We've now implemented the workflow that allows you to easily request one of these through the Sharewave platform such that whenever you need the valuation and the history behind it you'll find it all in one place.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Making a request</h2>
If you head over the to valuations section of Sharewave, you'll see a request valuation button in the top right. Clicking on this opens up a new form to submit for a valuation. There's quite a lot to fill out but you can save your progress at any time and return later.
