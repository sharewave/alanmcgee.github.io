excerpt: "Fast, incredibly easy 409a valuations."
---

Sharewave has created partnerships with some of the leading valuation firms, who offer exclusive pricing to our customers. These are fast, simply priced and audit defensible.

You can now easily request a 409a through the Sharewave platform. All the documentation for the request as well as the final paperwork generated from it will all live in one easily accessed and tracked location with the rest of your cap table data. Not only that but we'll use the valuation throughout Sharewave, including showing you the change in price inline with your transactions and warning you if you're issuing options below fair market value.

If you head over to the valuations section of Sharewave, you'll see a request valuation button in the top right. Clicking this opens up a form to submit for a valuation. There's quite a lot to fill out but you can save your progress at any time and return later. We'll prefill some fields based on your existing Sharewave data and you won't need to give the analyst team any cap table information because they'll take it from your Sharewave account. You can find full details of all the information you'll need to provide [in our docs](http://docs.sharewave.com/article/85-409a)

The pricing is simple and upfront, scaling with the number of preferred securities on your cap table.

<h2 style="text-align: left">The Process</h2>
After you submit, your analyst team will reach out within 1 business day to schedule a call. There is a guaranteed 10 business day turnaround from the day your analyst team confirms the data & documents are in order. At the end of 10 business days, draft exhibits will be presented for your review where you can ask questions and propose adjustments to the draft. Once you're happy, a final certified 409a valuation report will be delivered to you through Sharewave.
