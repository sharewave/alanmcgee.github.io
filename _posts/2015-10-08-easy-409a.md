<h2 style="text-align: left">409a</h2>
We recently announced our 409a partnership which allows us to offer 409a valuations that are fast, simply priced and audit defensible.

We've now add the workflow that allows you to easily request one of these through the Sharewave platform. Now at every step you'll always have everything you need. All the documentation for the request as well as the paperwork generated from it will all live in one easily accessed and tracked location with the rest of your cap table data.

If you head over the to valuations section of Sharewave, you'll see a request valuation button in the top right. Clicking on this opens up a new form to submit for a valuation. There's quite a lot to fill out but you can save your progress at any time and return later. We'll prefill some fields based on your existing Sharewave data and you won't need to give the valuation team any cap table information because they'll take it from your existing Sharewave cap table.

The pricing is simple and upfront and scales with the number of preferred securities on your cap table.
