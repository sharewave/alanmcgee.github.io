Here are some highlights of the new product that you'll now find on Sharewave:

<h2 style="text-align: left">Sharewave + HelloSign</h2>
We've teamed up with the great folks at HelloSign to provide a much more robust e-signature experience, and a much simpler workflow for you and your recipients from end-to-end.

<br><br>
This includes multi-party signature, ordered signatures, and a number of other great enhancements. It's available today in every account, and you can request unlimited e-signatures as part of your existing Sharewave subscription.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Pro forma round modeling</h2>
In addition to modeling an upcoming round, you can now identify existing or new investors to evaluate follow-on investments. This will show the resulting post-money percentage for each investment entity, along with the percent of the company that capital purchased and their pro rata percent of the new round.

<br><br>
One other enhancement that applies to both the round model and waterfall model: you can now save and share versions of models, and print the model directly from your browser.


<h2 style="text-align: left">Bulk cap table entry</h2>
This has been a long time coming. Instead of entering transactions one-by-one, you can now enter many transactions at once in our new bulk editor. Copy & paste directly from a spreadsheet and we'll validate the data in real-time.
