This week we've launched a brand new onboarding flow to make getting set up on Sharewave faster and easier than ever. It allows you to get the meat of your cap table into the platform quickly, and you'll then be given the opportunity to flesh out the details later.

It's as simple as answering a few questions and plugging in the basic numbers. If you know literally nothing about cap tables with this new tool you'll have your cap table up in minutes.
