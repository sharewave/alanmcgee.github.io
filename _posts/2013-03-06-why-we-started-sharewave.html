<p>In the spring of 2012, we set out to build an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding#Equity" title="equity crowdfunding" target="_blank">equity crowdfunding</a> platform, excited by the newly passed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpstart_Our_Business_Startups_Act" title="JOBS Act" target="_blank">JOBS Act</a>. We knew the SEC and FINRA would take their time drafting regulations around the new law, a process that could easily take up to a year (and we were right; they&#8217;re still not finished). </p>
<p><span>We researched the many types of crowdfunding platforms, not only in the equity space but also with the other platform areas such as donation, lending and reward-based. We were struck, not at how hard it was to find companies or customers, but how few features there were available post-funding. How will these companies manage their new funders?</span></p>
<p><span>Public companies call it “Investor Relations”. For the funders (or investors) of a private company however, there are no investor relations. Communication is rare, limited to occasional email (perhaps it’s even annual), unless you&#8217;re on the board or you keep bugging the CEO or CFO. </span></p>
<p><span>Communication is rare, because it&#8217;s not easy. Keeping investors informed becomes even more difficult as companies take on investors, especially from crowdfunding and it’s large hordes. Investor documents, permissions, audit trails, signatures, contact data and even board presentations can be a full-time job, but it shouldn&#8217;t be. Nor should you have to be an MBA (or hire one) to do it well.</span></p>
<p><span>We created Sharewave for entrepreneurs and private companies who care deeply about their investors. It&#8217;s a beautifully simple way to organize, visualize and share information with your investors. So you can spend more time leading your business and less time on it&#8217;s administration, no matter if you have one investor or one thousand. And just imagine how organized your future financings will be.</span></p>
<p><span>We&#8217;re currently in a closed beta, but are slowly accepting invitation requests as we work with early customers to ensure we get things right.
