*Every week we hand select thoughts and ideas from the startup community that we find most interesting.*

**Rob Go of Nextview** takes a step back to look at [The Biggest Threats to My Business](http://robgo.org/2014/09/02/biggest-threats-seed-funds/) as a VC. Among them are: 1) new competition, 2) skipping straight an A round, 3) non-institutional leads, 4) alternative funding sources, and 5) getting crammed down through follow-ons with the bull markets slows down.

**Fred Wilson of USV** reblogs a crowd favorite, explaining the cash flow method in [How To Calculate A Return On Investment](http://avc.com/2014/09/reblog-how-to-calculate-a-return-on-investment/).

**JD Alois of Crowdfund Insider** summarizes the [Recommended Term Sheet for Equity Crowdfunding Offers](http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2014/09/48727-cfpa-publishes-recommended-term-sheet-equity-crowdfunding-offers/) put forward by the CfPA this week. Major provisions include treating crowdfunded transactions as a separate security class, supermajority voting or to simplify the cap table by aggregating the class into a single holding entity, and anti-dilution protection for the class.

**Tom Tunguz of Redpoint** explores various comparisons in [The Best Way to Benchmark a SaaS Startup](http://tomtunguz.com/proper-benchmarking/).

**Brad Feld of Foundry Group** on Techstars recent decision to put their money where there mouth is in [Techstars Equity Back Guarantee](http://www.feld.com/archives/2014/09/techstars-equity-back-guarantee.html). In summary, "if at the end of the program you arenâ€™t delighted, you can ask for some or all of your equity back."

**Business Insider** details examples of [How 3 Startup CEOs Gave Up Fortunes To Turn Half Their Employees Into Millionaires](http://www.businessinsider.com/non-greedy-startup-ceos-who-turned-employees-into-millionaires-2014-9). Reflecting on Behance's sale to Adobe, founder Scott Belsky said "You don't have to limit yourself to what the cap chart is. You can say, 'Let's give a larger reward to this person vested over the coming years to send a message that all they have to do is continue helping the company moving forward.'"
