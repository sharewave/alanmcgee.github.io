<p>Why do we have so many protections against small investors participating in private equity?  Even with the recent JOBS act, which relaxes some of the restrictions, there is still considerable regulation, and hesitancy on the part of many who believe that allowing small investors to participate in private offerings is dangerous or ill-advised.</p>

<p>One of the reasons is the concern about access to information.  Much of the regulation imposed on public companies is related to how much information they must disseminate; how and when they must communicate to the investing public.  Non-public companies, on the other hand, are more ad hoc and erratic in their investor communications.  They tend to be smaller, on average, and often don&#8217;t have the resources required to focus on investor relations.  Hence, people who are well-connected to the company management will likely have access to better and more timely information than the investing public &#8212; handicapping the small investor&#8217;s ability to make informed decisions.  Hence, regulation.</p>

<p>Instead of relying on government to solve the problem, perhaps there is another way.  Perhaps we could make it easier for companies to communicate with their shareholders and the investing public.  That&#8217;s what Sharewave aims to do.  </p>

<p>Lewis (&#8220;Brainy&#8221;) Bernard of Morgan Stanley used to describe the function of an investment bank (in the 1980&#8217;s when most people didn&#8217;t know what an investment bank was) as &#8220;Facilitating Capital Flows&#8221;.  It was a three word phrase that pretty much covered all the various activities that an investment bank engaged in.  I like to think of the function of Sharewave as &#8220;Facilitating Information Flows&#8221;.  That covers a variety of activities that will democratize investing by providing more and better and timelier information to more people.  And that will reduce the need for regulation &#8212; at least for this reason.</p>

<p>If you can think of reasons why the relaxation of regulations embedded in the JOBS act is a bad idea, or if you can think of other ways to reduce the need for regulating private investment, let us know on twitter at @sharewaveteam.</p>
