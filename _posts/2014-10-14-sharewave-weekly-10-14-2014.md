*Every week we hand select thoughts and ideas from the startup community that we find most interesting.*

**This week's theme:** more companies raising more dollars in seed rounds, so what's a Series A these days?

**Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz** kicked off the week with [a cautionary note on twitter:](https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/519344050529251328) "No competent VC is actually fooled when you show up after raising $6M in seed financing and say you're now raising an A!"

**Mark Suster of Upfront Ventures** chimes in noting that more founders are naming A rounds as Seeds, but cap table structure and institutional money are better definitions in [What is the Definition of a Seed Round or an A Round?](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2014/10/07/what-is-the-definition-of-a-seed-round-or-an-a-round/).

**Tom Tunguz of Redpoint** takes a look at early stage data, which shows a 140% compound annual growth rate in multiple seed rounds since 2009 in [Second Seed Rounds: How They Impact a Startup's Ability to Raise a Series A](http://tomtunguz.com/second-seeds/). 

**CB Insights** added to the data, noting a 6X increase in "seed" rounds over $6M since 2010 in [Forever Young â€“ Companies Raising More Funding Prior to Series A](https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/series-a-seed-funding-companies/).
