Your cap table is simply a visualization of legal agreements between your company and your shareholders. It's a great way to view the distribution of ownership, but it's fairly meaningless without the underlying legal agreements to support the data.

When it's time to evaluate how a decision will impact you and your shareholders, such as an upcoming financing or valuation, you'll inevitably have to gather these documents to validate the state of your cap table. It's usually a lawyer or accountant (often both, independently) going through that process, and that takes a lot of time and money.

At Sharewave, we're building tools on top of your documents and legal agreements to make them more meaningful. That starts with the cap table, and this is the first of many steps that we're taking to connect the underlying documentation to your capitalization.

Every cap table entry can now be linked to documents, organizing your data and reducing costs from your lawyer and accountant.
