Sharewave has partnerships with leading valuation firms who offer exclusive pricing to our customers, and requesting a valuation just got simpler.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Do I really need a 409a valuation?</h2>

If you issue any form of equity compensation, avoiding 409a can introduce significant tax liabilities for your employees. We've made this a seamless process; with a few clicks you'll be introduced to a team of experts assigned to your company.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Requesting a valuation</h2>
With Sharewave, the entire process is electronic. Start by visiting your company valuations page, and click **Request Valuation**. We'll ask for specific financial and company data, which you can type in or attach documents to support the valuation. That combined with your cap table (which is already on Sharewave), will be used to assign a fair market value to your company stock.

A complete explanation of the information needed can be found [here in our knowledge center](http://docs.sharewave.com/article/85-409a). Once submitted, your valuation team will confirm the data and have a draft returned in 10 business days for your review. After your approval, a final certified 409a report will be added to your Sharewave account.

<h2 style="text-align: left">How we use your valuation data</h2>
The fair market value (FMV) will be used as your new default strike price when issuing equity compensation, reminds you if you're issuing below the new FMV, notifies you when the 409a is expiring so you stay in compliance, and you can even optionally display the FMV on all transactions so shareholders can see their gains.

<h2 style="text-align: left">How much does this cost?</h2>
Our prices are simple and upfront, scaling with the number of preferred securities on your cap table. Before you start the process, you'll know exactly what the cost is with no surprise fees.
