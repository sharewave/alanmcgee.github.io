*Every week we hand select thoughts and ideas from the startup community that we find most interesting.*

**Fred Wilson of Union Square** talks about the changing VC landscape, and how capturing pro-rata is so important for funds in [The Pro-Rata Opportunity](http://avc.com/2014/07/the-pro-rata-opportunity/).

**Semil Shah of Haystack Fund** provides a great summary of Dave McClure & 500 Startups' second annual conference in [Notes From The 2014 Pre-Money Conference](http://blog.semilshah.com/2014/07/19/notes-from-the-2014-pre-money-conference/). 

**Tom Tunguz of Redpoint** pours over NVCA & Thomson Reuters quarterly release of VC data in [The Coming Wave of Venture Capital and What it Means for Your Startup](http://tomtunguz.com/record-fundraising-year/). The summary: VC's are on pace to raise double the dollars raised in 2013, and that money has not been fully deployed to startups. If past trends hold and the capital entering the startup market doubles, the market for early stage software will be quite strong over the next 12-18 months.

**Kanyi Maqubela of Collaborative Fund** illustrates how liquidation preferences and pro-rata rights translate into [Upside Protection vs. Downside Protection](http://blog.kanyi.me/post/92732323908/upside-protection-vs-downside-protection).

**Coach Davender Gupta of Startup Acad√©mie** lists six points for founders to consider in [Equity is not Monopoly Money](http://blog.davender.com/2014/07/equity-is-not-monopoly-money/).
