At Sharewave, we’ve been working closely with fellow startups to bring more flexibility to how shareholder information is captured, presented and shared amongst small teams and their shareholders.

We’re excited to announce the release of our new cap table; completely rebuilt from the ground up to track every transaction with the rigor of an accounting system, without the dated experience of one. 

<h2 style="text-align: left">A Proper Ledger</h2>
Your cap table is your ownership structure, and is critical to making decisions that impact you and your shareholders. Like many startups we keep certain numbers in spreadsheets, but some things require an extra level of accuracy, security and versatility over time.

Now on Sharewave, all data entered into a cap table is wrapped within a unique transaction containing a type (e.g. issuance, transfer, conversion, etc), a unique ID, effectively dated in time and optionally supported by signed legal agreements. This gets more interesting as we build new products on top of these transactions, and we’ve already started with the following new ways to interact with your data:

<h2 style="text-align: left">Time Travel</h2>
<br>

Most companies keep a copy of their cap table in it’s current state, but there’s value in seeing what it looks like historically and at a future date. We’ve built a feature that let’s you travel through time to see your cap table near it’s beginning, or what it will look like in the future as options continue to vest. 

<h2 style="text-align: left">Filter Control</h2>
<br>

By default, our cap table loads every transaction fully diluted. But there are times you don’t want to see your convertible notes, or your unvested employee options. Now you have complete control over what security types are shown, whether options are displayed in vested or unvested form, and can also combine the filters with time travel to narrow in on activity over time.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Chronological Activity</h2>
<br>

Selecting a cell in your cap table provides much more than the number itself. You’ll have a much clearer interface to show how that number evolved into its current value, from the initial issuance through splits, repurchases, conversions, exercises, etc. laid out chronologically to clearly show its mathematical progression.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Transaction Log</h2>
<br>
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/cap-trans.png">
Every company will have a chronological view of every action taken on their cap table, from the first security issued to the last option exercised. You can easily search through history to filter transactions by shareholder, security, date, or transaction type. Selecting a transaction reveals the details of it’s underlying data, and the signed legal agreement supporting it.

We're excited to continue building on top of this data, and a very big thanks to the many startups who have supported us through continued feedback. <br><br>
