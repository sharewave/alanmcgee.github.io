<p>Some of our team have just arrived in Austin for SXSW Interactive. If you’re here, we’d love to talk to you about Sharewave. We’re currently in a closed beta, but our goal for SXSW is to introduce ourselves and hear about your investor relations challenges—whether you’re a startup or an investor.</p>
<p>Three of the team were here last year, where we won the 2012 SXSW Interactive People’s Choice Award (for AmericansElect.org). We’ve put together a great team and Sharewave brings together all of our diverse expertise:</p>
<p><strong>Joshua Levine, CEO, </strong>has a long history in financial technology, from institutions as a Managing Director in Technology at Morgan Stanley to retail traders at E*TRADE as their CTO, to asset managers as the CEO of ESP Technologies (bought by ITG) and now for private companies at Sharewave. He is on the board of several companies, including the online grocer FreshDirect and non-profits, including DonorsChoose.org helping classrooms in need.</p>
<p><strong>Robert M. Lefkowitz (a/k/a r0ml), CTO, </strong> is a technologist with a history of making information easier to access and analyze. He built financial trading systems at Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, analytics at AT&amp;T Wireless and Asurion, and visualizations at 1010data and Root Markets. He’s an ACM Distinguished Engineer and frequent speaker at Open Source conferences.</p>
<p><strong>Dexter Liu, COO,</strong> has a history of delivering large-scale web technology projects. Prior to Sharewave, Dexter was a Technical Project Director at DigitasLBi where he managed the largest portfolio for the US business and led the way for the agency to win two Clio awards and last year’s SXSW People’s Choice Award. He’s also an avid gadget geek and loves travelling the globe.</p>
<p><strong>Alan McGee, CMO,</strong> most recently worked on AmericansElect.org, where he oversaw digital marketing and analytics. Prior, he spent three years with DonorsChoose.org evaluating the marketing funnel through analytics and digital strategy as they became one of Fast Company’s “50 Most Innovative Companies in the World.” He was also a 2007 Kiva Fellow, and was (briefly) a mechanical engineer.</p>
<p><strong>Alison Iven</strong> is a designer with over five years of experience in web and app development and brand communications. Prior to Sharewave, she worked primarily with real estate and architecture clients and studied graphic design at the University of Cincinnati’s College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Walport</strong> was born in Blighty, growing up in London and eventually reading Physics at Oxford. He jumped across the pond for a pair of master’s degrees, Journalism and Computer Science, at Columbia University before joining the Sharewave team in January 2013. He previously took a brief sojourn into the arts working at BAM, but he had to talk to far too many people so decided software engineering was a safer pursuit.</p>
