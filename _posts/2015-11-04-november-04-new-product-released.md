Here are some highlights of new product now on Sharewave:

<h2 style="text-align: left">Bulk Contact Import</h2>
This week we've released an awesome new tool that allows you to get all your contacts onto Sharewave quickly and easily. Open up 'add contact' in your contacts sections and you'll now see a new bulk option. Copy and paste, press save and you'll have everything on Sharewave in seconds.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Permissions</h2>
Thus far we've allowed for the setting of permissions in clearly defined groups. We're now also going to allow you to set individual permissions at a more granular level. We'll be releasing this in phases over the next few months but first out the gate you can now finely control who has access to view and edit your company billing and settings.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Bulk Transaction Editing</h2>
Ever issued 15 option grants and then realized there was a typo in all of them? Now you can select as many transactions as you like and edit them all at once.

<h2 style="text-align: left">A number of smaller, but important updates</h2>
* A major speed boost to editing. Companies with very large cap tables should see major improvements in the responsiveness of exercising/converting/issuing etc.
* Waterfall outputs can now be downloaded as an xls.
* The date being viewed is now maintained across the site so those who've entered future events don't constantly have to change the date to see them.
* Splits have been optimized to run faster.
* To dos now include prompts to issue from unused securities and option pools.
