<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce that we&#8217;ve launched! Invites are rolling out in the order received, we can&#8217;t wait to introduce you to Sharewave.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s this morning&#8217;s <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/9/prweb11166526.htm">press release</a> announcing the news:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 class="title">Former E*TRADE CTO Launches Sharewave to Simplify Shareholder Management</h4>
<div><em>Award-Winning Team Releases Cloud-based Investor Relations for Private Companies</em><br/><br/></div>
<p>New York, NY (PRWEB) September 27, 2013&#8212;Sharewave, the cloud-based investor relations solution for private companies, today announced the launch of its innovative product to help companies easily maintain their shareholder records, employee options and company documents.</p>
<div><br/><p>“Sharewave is the hassle-free solution made exclusively for private companies, from the smallest startup to the largest pre-IPO.” said Joshua S. Levine, Sharewave co-founder and CEO. “It is simple, yet powerful and intuitive, so companies can spend more time building their business and less time worrying about stock records, option grants, investment dates and amounts, paperwork, signatures, certificates, audit trails and more.”</p>
<br/><p>Private companies are increasing in number, fueled by angel investors, venture capital, private equity and flexible financing options such as crowdfunding. Without Sharewave, they use a mixed bag of tools like Dropbox, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Adobe PDF, email and fax to manage and communicate with shareholders. This is all time consuming and painful, especially chasing down signatures, certificates and documents with no audit trail. Sharewave gives you everything you need to communicate with investors, including their level of interaction.</p>
<br/><p>Sharewave is free for startups and has clear, reasonable pricing for all private companies.

<p><strong>Award-winning team: </strong><br/>An extraordinary team, with leaders from finance, technology and marketing, have come together to bring Sharewave to fruition. The founders, Joshua S. Levine, former CTO of E*TRADE, Robert M. (“r0ml”) Lefkowitz, ACM Distinguished Engineer and former Chief Architect of AT&amp;T Wireless, Dexter Liu from DigitasLBi and Alan McGee from DonorsChoose.org, originally started out to produce a crowdfunding site for the 2012 JOBS act. In the process, they discovered that private companies need more help managing current investors than finding new ones.</p>
<br/><p>All together, the team has amassed many industry awards for their prior work, including a Webby, Stevie, SxSW People&#8217;s Choice, two Clio&#8217;s, several Inc. 5,000&#8217;s and even one finalist for Entrepreneur of the Year.</p><br>
<p><strong>About Sharewave: </strong><br/>Sharewave offers cloud-based investor relations for private companies. Unlike accounting solutions like FreshBooks and Intuit QuickBooks, Sharewave organizes a company’s most vital information, such as share ownership (capitalization tables), valuation data and waterfall modeling, employee stock and option grants, board presentations, resolutions and minutes, investor communication, document management, signatures and more. All with a complete audit trail of activity, including what’s been viewed, or modified, and by whom.</p>
