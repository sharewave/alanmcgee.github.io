*Every week we hand select thoughts and ideas from the startup community that we find most interesting.*

**Mark Organ of Influitive** says that there are now more tools to handle a larger shareholder base, so [pulling in an army of investors has more perks than you think](http://venturebeat.com/2014/06/20/pulling-in-an-army-of-investors-has-more-perks-than-you-think/).

**Tom Tunguz of Redpoint** shares slides from a recent talk entitled [The Five Forces Shaping The Fundraising Market](http://tomtunguz.com/five-forces-shaping-fundraising-market/), which are: 1) The fundraising marketing is stable, despite public market fluctuations, 2) startups are more capital efficient than they were 10 years ago, 3) for the most attractive startups, seed rounds have replaced Series A rounds, 4) Series Bs are the hardest to raise, and 5) growth stage megarounds have replaced or delayed IPOs.

**Nikki Durkin of 99dresses** shares the emotional ride of a founder's journey through the highs and lows in [My startup failed, and this is what it feels like](https://medium.com/@nikkidurkin99/my-startup-failed-and-this-is-what-it-feels-like-c5d64b3ae96b).

**Charlie O'Donnell of Brooklyn Bridge Ventures** explains why he's always clear about his reasons when he turns down an investment in [The Strong Rejection](http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2014/6/23/the-strong-rejection.html).

**Rob Go of NextView Ventures** reminds us that "investors try to provide help and governance, but the operators make the tough calls and are accountable for the results" in [How Much Should You Listen To Your Investors?](http://robgo.org/2014/06/23/how-much-should-you-listen-to-your-investors/).

**Hunter Walk of Homebrew** voices support for putting boards together early in [The Changing Attitude Towards Boards at Seed Stage Startups](http://hunterwalk.com/2014/06/22/the-changing-attitude-towards-boards-at-seed-stage-startups/).

**Chris DeVore of Founders Co-op** discusses startup fundraising stages as a stack, and that investors or founders who push the valuation too high or too low relative to norms can halt chances of progression in [The Valuation Stack](http://www.crashdev.com/2014/06/the-valuation-stack.html).

**Semil Shah of Haystack Fund** breaks down the block chain from an investors point of view in [A Brief Survey Of The Block Chain And Business Processes](http://blog.semilshah.com/2014/06/22/a-brief-survey-of-the-block-chain-and-business-processes/).
