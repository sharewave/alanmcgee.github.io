A fundamental of maintaining great shareholder relationships is strong communication. Preparing board members for quarterly discussions, seeking advice or introductions from advisors and investors, sending company metrics to employees are all important to founders and management teams.

In the past we've worked hard to ensure company information is easily shared in the form of documents and the cap table, so we're excited to add a new messaging feature to Sharewave.

We talked with many startups about their ideal communication, and discussed how we planned to use this for ourselves. In short, it's built to behave like email both when you're within and outside the platform.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Sending a message</h2>
Composing should look familiar, except that you no longer need to remember the email addresses of your contacts. Just start typing a name and we’ll autocomplete it for you. If you’ve grouped contacts (e.g. Board Members, Investors, etc.), enter the name of a group and everyone will get the email.

<h2 style="text-align: left">After a message is sent</h2>
From within your inbox you can view, sort and search company messages by recipient and subject line.

Every message also includes performance metrics to show successful sends, opens and bounces for each recipient. Now you’ll know exactly who has opened and read company messages, along with the date and time.

While messages start from our platform, the dialogue can continue entirely outside of Sharewave so your recipients don’t need to have Sharewave accounts. However, message responses pass through our platform so you can log in to see a complete history of the thread.
