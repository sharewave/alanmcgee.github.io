<p>Information transparency is critical for private companies. It fosters constructive feedback from stakeholders, keeps management focused on the long game, and reminds employees how far you’ve come.</p>
<p>In the spirit of transparency, we’re posting our own quarterly update for the public. The only piece we’ve removed is our budget and financials. We delivered this to our Shareholders via Google Docs, but our next will be delivered via Sharewave. Then we’ll simply create one document, mark our financials section as non-public, and know exactly who’s reviewed the information over time. That’s the power of Sharewave!</p>
<p>We hope to have you on the platform soon,</p>
<p>Josh, Founder of Sharewave</p>

<p><span>Dear Shareholders,</span></p>
<p>I’d like to update you on the progress of our company.</p><br>
<div><strong>Background</strong>
<p>As you know, we started out last summer investigating how we could capitalize on the crowdfunding movement in equities, courtesy of the JOBS Act passed in March 2012. In our research, we discovered plenty of companies started to go down our same path. </p>
<p>The promise of crowdfunding by non accredited equity investors, is the same promise that was offered by online brokers in the 1990’s &#8212; that is, access to investing previously only available to the wealthy. Like the online brokers, crowdfunding portals will have to find and acquire investors, make arrangements for company “IPOs” and provide tools to manage investors and portfolios of companies.</p><br>
<strong>Anxieties</strong>
<p>The online brokers already have spent the money to acquire the right crowd funder customers. Clearly, an online broker could enter the crowdfunding space and win easily, because they already have the investors. Every small company looking to use crowdfunding to raise capital would naturally come to an online broker that had the solution for small company “IPOs”. </p>
<p>The online brokers already have regulatory infrastructure. As the regulators have opined on the JOBS Act, they seem to be tipping towards crowdfunding portals as more heavily regulated entities than previously envisioned. With the SEC, FINRA and state regulators all involved, we can be sure the cost of regulation on the portal will be high. </p>
<p>Therefore, the chances of a successful run at building a crowdfunding portal, one that could compete with the online brokers, appears to be a high risk venture. </p>
<p>So the question is, why build one at all? </p><br>
<strong>Pivot</strong>
<p>All the 2012 crowdfunding startups are building and waiting for the SEC and FINRA to write the regulations. Many have decided not to wait at all. They have opted instead to build for accredited investors. Those solutions are basically traditional broker/dealer businesses and not technology products.</p>
<p>However, there is need for technology, one that not only solves problems for crowdfunded startups but for all private companies. This is what we have decided to focus our business on, solutions for managing all the stakeholders in a private company.</p><br>
<strong>About Sharewave </strong>
<p>Sharewave is the “best way to manage shareholders”. We consolidate all of a company’s capital information, safely and securely in a cloud solution. Not only share ownership information, but employee stock options, warrants and convertible debt too. We organize your documents, help you with option grant management, provide tools for board management and remove the need for faxes with our e-signature solution. Best of all, provide you with a complete audit trail with who has or has not looked at or signed anything.</p>
<p>We let your shareholders self serve so you’re not bogged down in administrivia. You even control what anyone can view down to the row and column, and even then, you can limit selected viewers to trends without revealing confidential details. Again, with a complete audit trail so you have a history of all shareholder interaction.</p><br>
<strong>Next Quarter</strong>
<p>I think we’re in great shape to release a great product by the end of this quarter. We just have to keep pushing to release and then fix, enhance and update the product as quickly as we can, so we can take on more companies. The addition of more companies will certainly stretch our product and our thinking about what solutions we’re providing. </p><br>
<p>I’m more excited about our prospects today than at anytime since we started the company. The need and opportunities are tremendous in the private company space. And the space is growing!</p><br>
<p>Thank you all for your patience. Feel free to give me a call anytime to discuss anything in more detail.</p><br>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>&#8212; Josh</p>
