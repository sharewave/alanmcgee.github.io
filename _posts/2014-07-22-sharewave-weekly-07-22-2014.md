*Every week we hand select thoughts and ideas from the startup community that we find most interesting.*

**Charles Hudson of SoftTech VC** explains why he takes meetings without reviewing presentations in advance in [False Positives, False Negatives, and Reading Decks in Advance](http://www.charleshudson.net/false-positives-false-negatives-and-reading-decks-in-advance). The highlights: 1) decks don't communicate personal connection and energy, 2) questions can be asked in real-time before an opinion is formed, 3) the secret sauce is not always in the deck, and 4) some people a good at describing but poor at deck creation.

**Tom Tunguz of Redpoint** copies his favorite quotes from "Done Deals" in [Lessons from Interviews of Pre-eminent VCs in 2000](http://tomtunguz.com/done-deals/).

**Brad Feld of Foundry Group** posted an email from a former FeedBurner co-founder, detailing AngelList Syndicate benefits and a few constructive feedback points in [AngelList Syndicate Feedback From An Experienced Entrepreneur](http://www.feld.com/archives/2014/07/angellist-syndicate-feedback-experienced-entrepreneur.html).

**Tren Griffin of Microsoft** put together a great list of learnings in [A Dozen Things Iâ€™ve Learned from Peter Thiel](http://25iq.com/2014/07/13/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-peter-thiel/).
